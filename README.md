# Scaffold
This project for the moment is a scaffold for application development in go. I would like to program in go with the
same agility that I program with other languages. With autowiring and even separating the infrastrcture from the business
logic.

## Disclaimer
This is an opinionated scaffold. This is for MY personal projects and this don't try to replace any go standard or
any idiomatic go recomendation/specification.
